# ViT-DenseFormer
This is an implementation of the DenseFormer architecture for Vision Transformers. 
<br>
The architecture is derived from â€” ["DenseFormer: Enhancing information flow in transformers via depth weighted averaging."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02622)



# vit
Template for ViT-based experiments. Has a strong dependancy on [`timm`](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models). ViT implementation code copied over from timm.
